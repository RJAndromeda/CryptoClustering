# CryptoClustering

Created and submitted as Challenge 19 for Monash University Data Analytics Boot Camp (October 2023).

Task: use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes, by:

- preparing the data

- finding best value for K using the scaled DF
- cluster using K-means on the scaled data
- optimising with PCA
- finding k with PCA data
- cluster with K-means using PCA data
- Discuss



I used course materials for this challenge, and referred to https://hvplot.holoviz.org/ and https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html
